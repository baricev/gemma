test_rope_positional_embeddings: "Verifies the apply_rope function against expected outputs."
type: "Function"
parameters_or_attributes:
  input_embedding_shape: "Shape of the input tensor under test."
  positions: "Position indices passed to apply_rope."
  max_wavelength: "Maximum wavelength parameter for rotary embeddings."
  expected: "Expected numeric output array."
code_description: |
  The test constructs an input tensor of ones, applies `gm.math.apply_rope` with
  the provided parameters, and asserts that the resulting array matches the
  expected values using NumPy's test utilities.
relationships:
  called_by:
    - pytest during unit testing
  calls:
    - gm.math.apply_rope
    - numpy.testing.assert_array_almost_equal
note: |
  This test is parametrized to allow multiple scenarios, although only one case
  is presently defined.
output_example: |
  When executed, pytest reports success if the rotated embeddings align with the
  expected array.
