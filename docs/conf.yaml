DocsConfigModule: "Generates Sphinx documentation by invoking apitree on Gemma modules and colab notebooks."
type: "Module"
parameters_or_attributes:
  _COLABS_NAMES: "List of colab notebook identifiers included in the generated docs."
code_description: |
  The module imports `apitree` and defines `_COLABS_NAMES` containing the names
  of example notebooks. It then calls `apitree.make_project` with mappings for
  Gemma modules and additional files to produce HTML documentation. The call
  also registers redirections from simple page names to their corresponding
  notebook pages and exposes variables from the current module to `apitree` via
  `globals()`.

note: |
  Run this script from the repository root after installing documentation
  dependencies using `pip install -e .[docs]`. The output is written under
  `docs/_build` when executed with `sphinx-build`.
output_example: |
  Running `sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build` creates HTML files such as
  `index.html` and converted colab notebooks like `colab_finetuning.html`.
